# MintMaker
MintMaker is designed to automate the process of checking and updating dependencies for components in Konflux. It utilizes [https://docs.renovatebot.com/](Renovate), a dependency update tool.

## Description

MintMaker introduces the DependencyUpdateCheck custom resource, which acts as a trigger for the dependency update process. When a DependencyUpdateCheck CR is created, MintMaker springs into action, examining all components within Konflux for dependency updates.

Konflux components originate from repositories on two types of platforms, GitHub and GitLab. MintMaker adapts its functionality based on the platform:

* GitHub: If the repository has Konflux's Pipeline as Code GitHub Application installed, MintMaker utilizes the token generated from the application to run Renovate.
* GitLab: MintMaker scans the component's namespace for a secret containing the Renovate token. Upon finding the token, MintMaker employs it to execute Renovate for components within the same namespace.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mintmaker:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mintmaker:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Testing

To run the tests, run:

```sh
make test
```

In case you are getting an error like this:

```sh
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

and in the trace you can see that the `controller-tools` version `v0.13.0` is being used, make sure to upgrade to `v0.14.0`.
To do that, run:

```sh
go install sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.14.0
GOBIN=$PWD/bin go install sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.14.0
./bin/controller-gen --version
```
